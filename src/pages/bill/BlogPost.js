    <h2>Notes on Bill (blog)</h2>
    <p>
      Since Bill Cunningham died, I’ve wanted to do some analysis on his work. I
      see this project not as analysis as much as it is exploration. Like when
      you look at the first 20 entries of a customer data set to see how the
      addresses are formatted. I am forming questions to ask when I can get my
      hands on all of his columns. I also see this as a project that will set me
      up to do many more projects about Bill.{" "}
    </p>

      One of the most impressive things about Bill Cunningham was how hard he
      worked--often 10-12 hour days. During the day, starting early in the
      morning, he would follow his eye to whoever was wearing something
      interesting and try to get the shot, notice trends, see something fresh.
      In the evenings he would be hopping from charity event to charity event to
      take pictures for his Evening Hours column. The man never stopped. I
      originally saw my heat map as a nod to how prolific he was. Now I see it
      as how constrained he was. According to one of his editors, he always
      wanted to be publishing more photos per column, but he got pushback.
      Legend has it that one day he pointed to photo mosaic on the front page
      and defiantly said that if they can do it, he can do it.{" "}

      Bill’s coverage of holidays simply had to be included. Within the first
      few pages of Bill’s memoir he talks about going to church on Easter
      Sunday:{" "}

    <blockquote>

        This was the dandy day of my life. I can’t remember a thing the priest
        said during Mass, but I sure as hell could describe every interesting
        fashion worn by the two hundred or so ladies...
      </i>
    </blockquote>

      The columns from fashion week had to be included because of his peculiar
      way of covering fashion week. His M.O. was to take more pictures of the
      attendees than he did of the models on the runway!{" "}
    </p>
    <p>
      You can tell from his work, but Bill’s editor Joanna Nikas and I sat down
      last week and she told me about how much he loved the weather. He loved
      how it affected how people dressed. He particularly loved when it was wet
      or snowy because people were less likely to pose for him. I included a
      theme called puddle-hopping so you can see.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were a million smaller things that I also wanted to include even if
      in small measure. For example, Bill's columns that focused on colors and
      patterns could be especially striking visually. I loved any time he
      focused on bright colors in particular. There is also a bag of mine that
      has a version in one of his columns. He loved animals and they were in
      many of his columns, so that's an option in the browse dashbpard. Also,
      Bill had some incredible pieces on men's fashion. That's also a filter on
      the browse dash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mostly I see this project as a new section of my second project. It's
      continuing an exploration of joy.
