Where do I look to keep my spirits buoyed? It didn't take long to figure it out. During my workday, it's my happy playlist (creatively titled The Happiest Playlist). It starts with Barbra Streisand and doesn't lose steam after that. I also have a particularly wonderful shoe collection, so I always have the option to just look down if I want to smile.
