During the day, starting early in the morning, he would follow his eye to whoever was wearing something interesting and try to get the shot, notice trends, see something fresh. In the evenings he would be hopping from charity event to charity event to take pictures for his Evening Hours column. The man never stopped. I originally saw my heat map as a nod to how prolific he was. Now I see it as how constrained he was. According to one of his editors, he always wanted to be publishing more photos per column, but he got pushback. Legend has it that one day he pointed to photo mosaic on the front page and defiantly said that if they can do it, he can do it."," "),n.a.createElement("p",null,"Bill’s coverage of holidays simply had to be included.
