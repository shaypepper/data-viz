 <p>\n      Since Bill Cunningham died, I’ve wanted to do some analysis on his work. I\n      see this project not as analysis as much as it is exploration. Like when\n      you look at the first 20 entries of a customer data set to see how the\n      addresses are formatted. I am forming questions to ask when I can get my\n      hands on all of his columns. I also see this as a project that will set me\n      up to do many more projects about Bill.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      One of the most impressive things about Bill Cunningham was how hard he\n      worked--often 10-12 hour days. During the day, starting early in the\n      morning, he would follow his eye to whoever was wearing something\n      interesting and try to get the shot, notice trends, see something fresh.\n      In the evenings he would be hopping from charity event to charity event to\n      take pictures for his Evening Hours column. The man never stopped. I\n      originally saw my heat map as a nod to how prolific he was. Now I see it\n      as how constrained he was. According to one of his editors, he always\n      wanted to be publishing more photos per column, but he got pushback.\n      Legend has it that one day he pointed to photo mosaic on the front page\n      and defiantly said that if they can do it, he can do it.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Bill’s coverage of holidays simply had to be included. Within the first\n      few pages of Bill’s memoir he talks about going to church on Easter\n      Sunday:{\" \"}\n    </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <i>\n        This was the dandy day of my life. I can’t remember a thing the priest\n        said during Mass, but I sure as hell could describe every interesting\n        fashion worn by the two hundred or so ladies...\n      </i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      The columns from fashion week had to be included because of his peculiar\n      way of covering fashion week. His M.O. was to take more pictures of the\n      attendees than he did of the models on the runway!{\" \"}\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      You can tell from his work, but Bill’s editor Joanna Nikas and I sat down\n      last week and she told me about how much he loved the weather. He loved\n      how it affected how people dressed. He particularly loved when it was wet\n      or snowy because people were less likely to pose for him. I included a\n      theme called puddle-hopping so you can see.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      There were a million smaller things that I also wanted to include even if\n      in small measure. For example, Bill's columns that focused on colors and\n      patterns could be especially striking visually. I loved any time he\n      focused on bright colors in particular. There is also a bag of mine that\n      has a version in one of his columns. He loved animals and they were in\n      many of his columns, so that's an option in the browse dashbpard. Also,\n      Bill had some incredible pieces on men's fashion. That's also a filter on\n      the browse dash.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Mostly I see this project as a new section of my second project. It's\n      continuing an exploration of joy.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n)\n\nexport default BlogPost\n","import React from \"react\"\n\nconst WhitePaper = () => (\n  <div>\n    <h2>Notes on design decisions and process (white paper)</h2>\n    <p>\n      When I set out to do this project, I didn’t expect it to be quite so\n      tedious. Lucky for me, my subject exudes joy. This meant that even at the\n      most infuriating moments, I was still genuinely happy to be working with\n      my source material. Doing meta-analysis on Bill Cunningham’s work is a\n      feast for the eyes.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The first difficult aspect was getting my hands on data. At first I tried\n      transcribing, then getting text from his columns, and even then, there was\n      little the data could tell me that I’d also be able to communicate via a\n      visual. Eventually, I tracked down the image of the way each column was\n      printed.Everything shifted when I was able to get those. For a digital,\n      interactive medium, seeing the full page spread communicates much more\n      than text analysis. Text analysis is only interesting when the audience\n      already has a context for what you’re analyzing.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      With only images, there’s very little given to you beyond date and title.\n      So I chose to start categorizing what I had. I tagged each column with as\n      many interesting features as I could think of. I started out looking at\n      fashion trend topics like popular bag styles or cuts of skirts/dresses. It\n      turned out that other than color, most of these were so specific that they\n      became hard to generalize. Perhaps if I had a few decades of work and not\n      just a few years, I could have documented those more easily. More often\n      Bill was focused on color, a broader theme, or holidays.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      I began with holidays. Since I had several years of data, I knew I should\n      have several columns per holiday (yes, fashion week is a holiday because\n      it’s annual and it’s a big deal). I wanted to show comparisons of\n      quantity, but not with precision. A bar chart would have made it seem like\n      the actual number of columns for any given holiday was important. I wanted\n      to show emphasis, but actual numbers were less important. I want the\n      audience to think “Oh! There were a lot of Christmas columns. Let’s\n      explore.” instead of, “Oh! There are 19 New York fashion week columns but\n      only 18 from Paris Fashion Week.” With the packed bubble chart you would\n      have to try to notice that. Putting that data in the tooltip makes the\n      comparison more convoluted--in a good way. Plus, I really wanted to\n      include this section because we are at the beginning of winter and it’s\n      holiday season. The packed bubble chart reminded me of ornaments on a\n      tree. Hopefully it’s obvious, but I also chose colors that would match the\n      holiday.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      I went through a few iterations of the list of columns on the right.\n      Originally it was a filled box to match the holiday color in the packed\n      bubble chart with white text. It started looking really funky when you got\n      down to holidays with only a single column. Plus, I was going for playful\n      and it read as juvenile. The white background makes for a cleaner\n      experience too. The richness of the columns shouldn’t be competed with too\n      heavily. To have both the packed bubble and huge blocks of color was just\n      too much.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      For both the Theme and Holiday dashboards I used an extra word chart for\n      the titles. This allowed me to use color and to make that title dynamic.\n      Initially I had this dynamically changing title in the top right hand\n      corner of the visualization. When I did user testing around my office,\n      that title wasn’t even noticed when it was in the corner. This is a bigger\n      problem when the elected holiday doesn’t have a labeled bubble. When I\n      moved the holiday/theme title to be just above the column list, it made it\n      clearer that those columns were part of that particular category. In the\n      holiday visualization, it also made the user instruction easier to\n      distinguish and read.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      A struggle was getting user interactions right. The opacity change of\n      unselected items is hard to work around. This became an issue on the So,\n      if a user selects a particular column to look at, they can no longer read\n      the names of the other columns. This makes it hard to know where you’re\n      navigating next. Then sometimes it becomes difficult to de-select. Because\n      of this, I decided to use hover as my action instead. The tradeoff is that\n      it makes it harder to zoom in on anything. In both iterations, I saw users\n      getting confused and frustrated about when to click and where to go next.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      I included interaction prompts on this project. I found this to be\n      especially important on the browse screen. The date slider is one of the\n      less intuitive parts of the screen so I wanted to make sure that the\n      functionality available was clear.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Since these visualizations had similar functionality, design consistency\n      across screens was very important. I made use of the dashboard format\n      tools for things like precise positioning and sizing. This was important\n      for the container for the column images and also for the titles. I used a\n      sans serif fonts that I thought most closely resembled the ON THE STREET\n      title in the columns. I also wanted my navigation titles to be more\n      declarative and to follow a pattern. Short punchy sentences since that’s\n      how his column titles were: short and punchy.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      For the column images themselves, I wanted them to fill up as much of the\n      screen as was reasonable. For this reason, I made my story and the\n      individual dashboards larger in size. You really need to go full screen\n      mode. There is just so much packed into each column that the smaller the\n      image, the more information and detail you lose.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The color dashboard is a late addition but maybe my favorite. The use of\n      the waffle chart feels playful and clean. There was a small enough number\n      of columns that focused on color that this feels both rich and not\n      overwhelming. Initially the colors of the columns were pretty random. On a\n      suggestion from a woman named Eve who was looking my visualization over, I\n      rearranged the order to look more like a rainbow. It immediately somehow\n      felt both more playful and cleaner. Cha-ching.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The only idea I had coming in to this visualization that survived was the\n      heat map. I used a color to match Bill’s blue work jacket since this\n      number is tied to his work ethic. I wanted to add a label so that the user\n      wouldn’t have to hover to see the number of images. At some point, having\n      those tiny numbers in squares looked really busy. I felt the circles made\n      the visualization feel softer. Originally, the two charts for 2015 and\n      2016 were stacked. Because of the sizing decision I made for the columns,\n      this felt very sparse. I made the years side by side to fill the space.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      It doesn't feel like much unto itself, but I needed the browse\n      visualization. I added it an hour before our final presentation. I just\n      felt there should be a place where the reader could do their own exploring\n      without such rigidity around what would be displayed. It also helped me\n      sneak in a few otther mini-themes.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      This has been a great semester on learning iteration and how to be\n      deliberate about my design choices. For the first time I feel comfortable\n      taking a data set and being able to envsion interesting visualizations\n      that could tell a story.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      The hardest decision I made all semester, of course, is what I was gong to\n      wear on Thursday.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n)\n\nexport default WhitePaper\n","/**\n * Layout component that queries for data\n * with Gatsby's useStaticQuery component\n *\n * See: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/use-static-query/\n */\n\nimport React from \"react\"\nimport PropTypes from \"prop-types\"\nimport Layout from \"../../components/layout\"\nimport BillViz from \"./visualization\"\nimport WhitePaper from \"./WhitePaper\"\nimport BlogPost from \"./BlogPost\"\n\nconst Bill = () => {\n  return (\n    <Layout styles={{ maxWidth: 1300, paddingBottom: 50 }}>\n      <div>\n        <BillViz />\n      </div>\n      <BlogPost />\n      <WhitePaper />\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n\nBill.propTypes = {\n  children: PropTypes.node.isRequired,\n}\n\nexport default Bill\n","import React from \"react\"\n\nclass BillViz extends React.Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    var divElement = document.getElementById(\"viz1576397550540\")\n    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName(\"object\")[0]\n    vizElement.style.width = \"1250px\"\n    vizElement.style.height = \"987px\"\n    var scriptElement = document.createElement(\"script\")\n    scriptElement.src = \"https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js\"\n    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement)\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div\n        class=\"tableauPlaceholder\"\n        id=\"viz1576397550540\"\n        style={{ position: \"relative\", marginBottom: 50 }}\n      >\n        <noscript>\n          <a href=\"#\">\n            <img\n              alt=\" \"\n              src=\"https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Bi&#47;BillPlay&#47;Bill&#47;1_rss.png\"\n              style={{ border: \"none\" }}\n            />\n          </a>\n        </noscript>\n        <object class=\"tableauViz\" style={{ display: \"none\" }}>\n          <param name=\"host_url\" value=\"https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F\" />{\" \"}\n          <param name=\"embed_code_version\" value=\"3\" />{\" \"}\n          <param name=\"site_root\" value=\"\" />\n          <param name=\"name\" value=\"BillPlay&#47;Bill\" />\n          <param name=\"tabs\" value=\"no\" />\n          <param name=\"toolbar\" value=\"yes\" />\n          <param\n            name=\"static_image\"\n            value=\"https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Bi&#47;BillPlay&#47;Bill&#47;1.png\"\n          />{\" \"}\n          <param name=\"animate_transition\" value=\"yes\" />\n          <param name=\"display_static_image\" value=\"yes\" />\n          <param name=\"display_spinner\" value=\"yes\" />\n          <param name=\"display_overlay\" value=\"yes\" />\n          <param name=\"display_count\" value=\"yes\" />\n          <param name=\"filter\" value=\"publish=yes\" />\n        </object>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default BillViz\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
