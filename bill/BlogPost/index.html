I see this project not as analysis as much as it is exploration. Like when you look at the first 20 entries of a customer data set to see how the addresses are formatted. I am forming questions to ask when I can get my hands on all of his columns. I also see this as a project that will set me up to do many more projects about Bill.<!-- --> </p><p>One of the most impressive things about Bill Cunningham was how hard he worked--often 10-12 hour days. During the day, starting early in the morning, he would follow his eye to whoever was wearing something interesting and try to get the shot, notice trends, see something fresh. In the evenings he would be hopping from charity event to charity event to take pictures for his Evening Hours column. The man never stopped. I originally saw my heat map as a nod to how prolific he was. Now I see it as how constrained he was. According to one of his editors, he always wanted to be publishing more photos per column, but he got pushback. Legend has it that one day he pointed to photo mosaic on the front page and defiantly said that if they can do it, he can do it.<!-- --> </p><p>Bill’s coverage of holidays simply had to be included. Within the first few pages of Bill’s memoir he talks about going to church on Easter Sunday:<!-- --> </p><blockquote><i>This was the dandy day of my life. I can’t remember a thing the priest said during Mass, but I sure as hell could describe every interesting fashion worn by the two hundred or so ladies...</i></blockquote><p>The columns from fashion week had to be included because of his peculiar way of covering fashion week. His M.O. was to take more pictures of the attendees than he did of the models on the runway!<!-- --> </p><p>You can tell from his work, but Bill’s editor Joanna Nikas and I sat down last week and she told me about how much he loved the weather. He loved how it affected how people dressed. He particularly loved when it was wet or snowy because people were less likely to pose for him. I included a theme called puddle-hopping so you can see.</p><p>There were a million smaller things that I also wanted to include even if in small measure. For example, Bill&#x27;s columns that focused on colors and patterns could be especially striking visually. I loved any time he focused on bright colors in particular. There is also a bag of mine that has a version in one of his columns. He loved animals and they were in many of his columns, so that&#x27;s an option in the browse dashbpard. Also, Bill had some incredible pieces on men&#x27;s fashion. That&#x27;s also a filter on the browse dash.</p><p>Mostly I see this project as a new section of my second project. It&#x27;s continuing an exploration of joy.</p></div></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/bill/BlogPost/";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"app":["/app-5e8294c1f57021c5ae68.js"],"component---src-pages-404-js":["/component---src-pages-404-js-1f5788961a6eedef6e61.js"],"component---src-pages-bill-blog-post-js":["/component---src-pages-bill-blog-post-js-65e21f984b6506b159aa.js"],"component---src-pages-bill-d-3-viz-js":["/component---src-pages-bill-d-3-viz-js-c7824ddc6734eb932a8e.js"],"component---src-pages-bill-index-js":["/component---src-pages-bill-index-js-778a388089f2f41db043.js"],"component---src-pages-bill-visualization-js":["/component---src-pages-bill-visualization-js-b62b84b1db455be52693.js"],"component---src-pages-bill-white-paper-js":["/component---src-pages-bill-white-paper-js-db89c4b427d450eeb231.js"],"component---src-pages-blog-2-js":["/component---src-pages-blog-2-js-9f8055fe1fa3efd3ea04.js"],"component---src-pages-happy-dog-js":["/component---src-pages-happy-dog-js-5cc5a3ca01e427b6d784.js"],"component---src-pages-happy-index-js":["/component---src-pages-happy-index-js-5b37d76685b22a64e32a.js"],"component---src-pages-happy-playlist-js":["/component---src-pages-happy-playlist-js-4cc01256af5fc1a82612.js"],"component---src-pages-happy-quanitifed-self-layout-js":["/component---src-pages-happy-quanitifed-self-layout-js-6d87e8f1e39ee375b17e.js"],"component---src-pages-happy-shoes-js":["/component---src-pages-happy-shoes-js-d25c82770c6629f28c5f.js"],"component---src-pages-index-js":["/component---src-pages-index-js-b44658cf30ea815e6232.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/component---src-pages-bill-blog-post-js-65e21f984b6506b159aa.js" async=""></script><script src="/app-5e8294c1f57021c5ae68.js" async=""></script><script src="/commons-7b49ddf2d69034c50912.js" async=""></script><script src="/webpack-runtime-20b95aa355bddc1a3ac8.js" async=""></script></body></html>
